# game-design-document ()

**A community-created skill for Claude that generates professional, publisher-grade Game Design Documents.**

> **Note:** This is an independent, community-created project. It is not an official Anthropic product. It is designed to work as a skill with Claude (via Claude.ai, Claude Code, or the Anthropic API).

Turn any game concept — from a one-line idea to a half-developed vision — into a comprehensive 40-80 page Game Design Document in `.docx`, `.pdf`, and `.pptx` format. This skill conducts a structured discovery interview, generates a tailored outline for approval, then writes complete GDD content at a quality standard suitable for AAA studios, indie publishers, and investor pitches.

## Installation

### Claude.ai (claude.ai)

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Zip the `game-design-document/` folder: `zip -r game-design-document.zip game-design-document/`
3. Open Claude.ai → Settings → Skills
4. Click **Upload Skill** → select `game-design-document.zip`
5. The skill is now available in all conversations

### Claude Code (CLI or VS Code Extension)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ityes22/game-design-document.git
cd game-design-document
```

Then open the folder in VS Code (or `cd` into it in the CLI). Claude reads the `CLAUDE.md` project instructions automatically and the skill is active. Just describe your game concept and it will start the GDD workflow.

### API Usage (Anthropic API)

Attach the `SKILL.md` content as a system prompt addition or use the Skills API endpoint:

```python
import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic()

# Read the SKILL.md content
with open("game-design-document/SKILL.md", "r") as f:
    skill_content = f.read()

# Add to your system prompt
response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-opus-4-6",
    max_tokens=8096,
    system=f"""You are a helpful assistant with the following skill active:

{skill_content}""",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "I want to create a GDD for my roguelike deckbuilder game."}
    ]
)
```

---

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Simply describe your game concept and ask for a GDD:

```
"I want to create a GDD for my game. It's a roguelike deckbuilder set in a cyberpunk city."

"Help me write a game design document for a mobile RPG with gacha mechanics."

"Create a professional GDD for my competitive multiplayer shooter concept."

"I need a game design document for my indie puzzle platformer."
```

### Targeted Usage

Request specific sections or document types:

```
"Write just the mechanics specification for my card combat system."

"Generate a pitch deck for my game — I have a rough GDD already."

"Create a one-page pitch for my mobile game concept."

"Expand my existing mechanics doc into a full GDD."
```

### Workflow Example

The skill follows a 4-phase workflow:

**1. Discovery Interview**
The skill asks 2-3 focused batches of questions about your game concept. This takes 5-10 minutes but prevents re-work. Answer as specifically as you can.

**2. Outline Approval**
You receive a tailored 19-section outline. Review it, request changes, confirm sections to skip, and approve before full writing begins.

**3. Content Generation**
The skill writes each section at professional quality — specific numbers, design rationale, parameter tables, and designer notes. Expect 2,000-8,000 words per major section.

**4. Document Export**
Run the provided Python scripts to generate polished `.docx`, `.pdf`, and `.pptx` files ready for distribution.

---

## Python Script Dependencies

Install required packages before running export scripts:

```bash
pip install python-docx fpdf2 python-pptx
```

Or install via the pinned requirements file:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Requires Python 3.10 or later.**

**Script usage:**
```bash
# Generate Word document
python scripts/generate_gdd_docx.py --title "My Game" --output "MyGame_GDD_v01.docx"

# Generate PDF
python scripts/generate_gdd_pdf.py --title "My Game" --output "MyGame_GDD_v01.pdf"

# Generate pitch deck
python scripts/generate_pitch_deck_pptx.py --title "My Game" --output "MyGame_Pitch.pptx"

# Generate one-pager
python scripts/generate_one_pager_pdf.py --title "My Game" --output "MyGame_OnePager.pdf"
```

---

## Customization

### Adding Custom Templates

Add custom section templates to `templates/` and reference them in the `SECTIONS` registry:

```python
# In scripts/utils/section_registry.py
SECTIONS["my_custom_section"] = {
    "name": "My Custom Section",
    "order": 20,
    "required": False,
    "min_words": 300,
    "key_elements": ["element1", "element2"],
    "template_file": "templates/my_custom_template.md"
}
```

### Modifying Document Styles

Edit `scripts/utils/docx_styles.py` to customize colors, fonts, and formatting:

```python
# Change primary brand color
COLORS = {
    "primary": "1A3C5E",      # Dark navy
    "accent": "E8B84B",        # Gold
    "callout_bg": "EEF4FB",   # Light blue callout background
    # ...
}
```

### Genre-Specific Configurations

The skill automatically adapts to genre, but you can pre-configure defaults by setting the genre in a session opener:

```
"I'm building a mobile F2P game. When I ask for GDD help, always start
with the mobile F2P template and expand monetization to 4+ pages."
```

## Example Output Quality

This skill generates GDD content at the level of published postmortems and publicly available studio documents. Example from a generated mechanics section:

> **Dodge Roll**
> **Category:** Core Movement
> **Input:** Hold [Left Stick] direction + press [Circle/B] during any non-stunned state
> **System:** Player becomes invincible for frames 3-11 of 20-frame animation. Moves character 4 meters in input direction. Consumes 1 Stamina point (max 3, regenerates 1 per 2.5s).
> **Feedback:** 10-frame afterimage trail (white, fading opacity), whoosh SFX, brief camera pull-back (0.05s)
> **Parameters:**
> | Parameter | Default | Min | Max | Notes |
> |-----------|---------|-----|-----|-------|
> | Invincibility frames | 3-11 | — | — | Fixed, not upgradeable |
> | Distance | 4.0m | 2.0m | 6.0m | Upgradeable via skill tree |
> | Stamina cost | 1 | 0 | 1 | Never free to preserve scarcity |
> | Stamina regen | 2.5s/point | 1.5s | 4.0s | Rebalanced per playtest |
