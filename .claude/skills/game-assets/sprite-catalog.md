# Sprite Catalog

Complete catalog of sprite archetypes for pixel art game assets. Grid sizes vary by archetype — from 8x8 for tiny pickups to 32x48 for personality characters. The default scale is 3 (each pixel becomes 3x3 on screen).

When creating sprites for a game, match the archetype to the entity type.

## Design Philosophy: Push the Pose

Before choosing an archetype, consider what each entity represents thematically:

- **Real people** → Always use the Personality Character archetype. Exaggerate their most recognizable feature until it's almost a caricature. Recognition is everything.
- **Companies/brands** → Incorporate logo shapes into the sprite. Use brand colors as the primary palette. Consider anthropomorphizing the logo (add limbs, face, expressions).
- **Game objects** → Must be instantly recognizable real-world objects, never abstract shapes. A collectible representing "creative output" could be a painting, a polaroid, a film reel — not a generic diamond or spark.
- **Opponents** → Each must be visually distinct. Different silhouettes, color palettes, and proportions. If they represent specific entities (rival companies, other people), build that identity into the sprite.

When in doubt, make it MORE recognizable, MORE exaggerated, MORE character-driven. We dial back, never up.

## Personality Character (South Park Photo-Composite)

For games featuring real people or named personalities (Altman, Amodei, Musk, Zuckerberg, etc.). Photo heads composited onto South Park-style cartoon bodies — instantly recognizable, no hand-drawn pixel art needed.

- **Dimensions**: 200x300 per frame (frameWidth: 200, frameHeight: 300)
- **Spritesheet**: Horizontal strip with all expressions
- **Source**: Pre-built in the character library at `assets/characters/` (relative to plugin root)
- Head occupies 65% of sprite height — large, recognizable photo on a small cartoon body
- Must be the largest entity on screen — supporting entities stay at Medium (16x16) or Small (12x12)

### Expression Frame Index Reference

Frame indices are fixed and consistent across all characters:

| Frame | Expression | Use Case |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| 0 | normal | Default/idle state |
| 1 | happy | Score point, collect item, win |
| 2 | angry | Take damage, lose life, opponent scores |
| 3 | surprised | Power-up, special event, streak milestone |

Not all characters have all 4 expressions — check `manifest.json` for available frames. If a character has only 3 frames (normal, happy, angry), don't reference frame 3.

### Loading in Phaser

```js
// Preloader
this.load.spritesheet('sam-altman', 'assets/characters/sam-altman/spritesheet.png', {
  frameWidth: 200,
  frameHeight: 300,
});

// Create sprite
this.sprite = scene.physics.add.sprite(x, y, 'sam-altman', EXPRESSION.NORMAL);
```

### Character Feature Reference

Physical descriptions for commonly-appearing tech figures. Use these to select source images for new character builds.

| Person | Slug | Body Type | Expressions | Key Feature |
|--------|------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Sam Altman | sam-altman | casual | 4 (normal, happy, angry, surprised) | Gray hoodie + round face |
| Dario Amodei | dario-amodei | suit | 4 | Curly hair + glasses + beard |
| Elon Musk | elon-musk | casual | 4 | Receding hairline + broad jaw |
| Mark Zuckerberg | mark-zuckerberg | casual | 4 | Curly top + blank expression |
| Satya Nadella | satya-nadella | suit | 4 | Bald + glasses |
| Sundar Pichai | sundar-pichai | suit | 3 (normal, happy, angry) | Slim face + neat dark hair |
| Jensen Huang | jensen-huang | leather-jacket | 4 | Black leather jacket |
| Andrej Karpathy | andrej-karpathy | casual | 3 (normal, happy, angry) | Wavy hair + stubble |

## Humanoid (Player, NPC, Warrior)

Key features: Head (2-3px wide), body (3-4px wide), legs (2 columns). Arms optional at 16x16. Distinguish characters via hair/hat color and body color.

## Item / Pickup (Gem, Coin, Heart, Orb)

Key features: Small (8x8 or 12x12), bright colors, simple symmetric shape. Often animated with a bob tween rather than frame animation.

```js
// XP Gem — diamond shape, 8x8
export const XP_GEM = [
  [0,0,0,4,4,0,0,0],
  [0,0,4,4,4,4,0,0],
  [0,4,4,8,4,4,4,0],

## Background Tile (Ground, Floor, Terrain)

Key features: Seamless tiling, subtle variation between tiles, low contrast so entities stand out. Use 16x16 tiles at scale 2 (32x32px each).

```js
// sprites/tiles.js — background tile variants

// Ground tile — base terrain (dark earth / stone)
export const GROUND_BASE = [
  [2,2,2,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,2,2,2,2,2],
  [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2],
  [2,2,2,2,2,2,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,2],
  [2,2,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2],
  [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,2,2,2,2,2,2],
  [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2],
  [1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,2,2,2],
  [2,2,2,2,2,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2],

  [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2],
  [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2],
  [2,2,2,2,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2],
  [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,1,2,2,2,2,2],
  [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2],
];

// Variant tiles — alternate with GROUND_BASE for variety
export const GROUND_VAR1 = [ /* same size, different speckle pattern */ ];
export const GROUND_VAR2 = [ /* ... */ ];
```

## Decorative Elements (8x8 to 16x16)

Small props scattered on the ground at random positions. Not tiles — placed once during scene creation.

```js
// Gravestone — 8x12
export const GRAVESTONE = [
  [0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0],
  [0,1,18,18,18,18,1,0],
  [0,1,18,8,8,18,1,0],
  [0,1,18,18,18,18,1,0],
  [0,1,18,18,18,18,1,0],
  [0,1,18,18,18,18,1,0],
  [0,1,18,18,18,18,1,0],
  [0,1,18,18,18,18,1,0],
  [0,1,18,18,18,18,1,0],
  [1,18,18,18,18,18,18,1],
  [1,18,18,18,18,18,18,1],
  [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],
];

// Bone pile — 8x6
export const BONE_PILE = [
  [0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0],
  [0,8,8,8,8,8,8,0],
  [8,18,8,8,8,18,8,8],
  [0,8,8,8,8,8,8,0],
  [0,8,18,8,8,18,8,0],
  [0,0,8,8,8,8,0,0],
];

// Torch — 6x12 (flickering tip animated via tween tint, not extra frame)
export const TORCH = [
  [0,0,4,4,0,0],
  [0,4,12,12,4,0],
  [0,0,4,4,0,0],
  [0,0,1,1,0,0],
  [0,0,19,19,0,0],
  [0,0,19,19,0,0],
  [0,0,19,19,0,0],
  [0,0,19,19,0,0],
  [0,0,19,19,0,0],
  [0,0,19,19,0,0],
  [0,0,19,19,0,0],
  [0,0,1,1,0,0],
];
```

## Tiled Background Rendering

Use `renderPixelArt()` to create tile textures, then fill the world with `tileSprite`:

```js
// In the game scene's create():
import { renderPixelArt } from '../core/PixelRenderer.js';
import { GROUND_BASE, GROUND_VAR1, GROUND_VAR2 } from '../sprites/tiles.js';
import { PALETTE } from '../sprites/palette.js';

// Render tile textures
renderPixelArt(scene, GROUND_BASE, PALETTE, 'tile-ground-0', 2);
renderPixelArt(scene, GROUND_VAR1, PALETTE, 'tile-ground-1', 2);
renderPixelArt(scene, GROUND_VAR2, PALETTE, 'tile-ground-2', 2);

// Option A: TileSprite for infinite seamless ground
const bg = scene.add.tileSprite(0, 0, WORLD_WIDTH, WORLD_HEIGHT, 'tile-ground-0');
bg.setOrigin(0, 0);
bg.setDepth(-10);

// Option B: Random tile grid for variety (better visual result)
const tileSize = 32; // 16px * scale 2
for (let y = 0; y < WORLD_HEIGHT; y += tileSize) {
  for (let x = 0; x < WORLD_WIDTH; x += tileSize) {
    const variant = Math.random() < 0.7 ? 'tile-ground-0'
                  : Math.random() < 0.5 ? 'tile-ground-1'
                  : 'tile-ground-2';
    scene.add.image(x + tileSize / 2, y + tileSize / 2, variant).setDepth(-10);
  }
}

// Scatter decorative elements
const decorTypes = ['deco-gravestone', 'deco-bones', 'deco-torch'];
for (let i = 0; i < 40; i++) {
  const dx = Phaser.Math.Between(100, WORLD_WIDTH - 100);
  const dy = Phaser.Math.Between(100, WORLD_HEIGHT - 100);
  const type = Phaser.Utils.Array.GetRandom(decorTypes);
  const deco = scene.add.image(dx, dy, type);
  deco.setDepth(-5);
  deco.setAlpha(0.6 + Math.random() * 0.4);
}
```

## Background Design Rules

1. **Low contrast** — background tiles should be 2-3 shades of the same dark color. Entities must pop against the background.
2. **Subtle variation** — use 2-3 tile variants with different speckle patterns. Random placement breaks repetition.
3. **Decorative props** — scatter 20-50 small decorations across the world. Low alpha (0.5-0.8) keeps them subtle.
4. **Match the theme** — gothic games: gravestones, bones, dead trees. Sci-fi: metal panels, pipes, lights. Nature: grass tufts, flowers, rocks.
5. **Depth layering** — tiles at depth -10, decorations at -5, entities at 5-15. Never let background compete with gameplay.
